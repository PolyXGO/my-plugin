== Description ==

Plugin supports managing, creating, and optimizing time-related content automatically. For anniversaries, holidays, founding days, historical milestones, etc., older posts often need adjustments for the new year. If there are only a few posts, this is manageable, but when their number is large, editing each post becomes time-consuming and inefficient. PXGCelebrations plugin effectively solves this issue.
